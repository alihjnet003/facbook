<h3>Why should you have Facebook House Rules?</h3>

<!--INSERT THE IMAGE HERE-->



<p>
Imagine that Facebook is like a playground, where your brand can regularly connect with people and build strong relationships.
As you know not everyone plays fair, and each Fan Page has its bullies posting negative or abusive comments;
that’s why it’s crucial to publish ‘House Rules’ that will clearly state the purpose of your Facebook Page and identify inappropriate
content that can (and probably should) be removed.
